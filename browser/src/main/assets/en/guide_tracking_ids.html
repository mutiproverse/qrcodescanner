        <h3><svg class="header"><use href="../shared_images/location_off.svg#icon"/></svg> Do Not Track</h3>

        <p>A few years ago the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) created a mechanism for browsers to inform web servers that they would not like to be tracked.
            This is accomplished by including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">DNT (Do Not Track) header</a> with web requests.</p>

        <p>The DNT header doesn't really provide any privacy because most web servers ignore it. For example, Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook all ignore at least some DNT headers.
            Beginning with version 3.8, Privacy Browser no longer has the option to send a DNT header.</p>


        <h3><svg class="header"><use href="../shared_images/link_off.svg#icon"/></svg> URL Modification</h3>

        <p>Privacy Browser removes tracking IDs and AMP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_Mobile_Pages">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a>) redirects from URL queries.
            There is a blog post that is updated with the <a href="https://www.stoutner.com/url-modification/">current list</a> of modifications.
            URL modification can be turned off in the settings if it is causing issues.</p>


        <h3><svg class="header"><use href="../shared_images/disabled_by_default.svg#icon"/></svg> X-Requested-With Header</h3>

        <p>Google programmed Androidâ€™s WebView to send an <a href="https://www.stoutner.com/the-x-requested-with-header/">X-Requested-With header</a> with every request.
            The value of the X-Requested-With header is set to the application ID, which in the case of Privacy Browser is <code>com.redlable.privacybrowser.standard</code>.
            This can be disabled using <a href="https://www.stoutner.com/webview-devtools/">WebView's DevTools</a>.</p>
