        <p>The bookmark drawer may be opened by swiping from the right edge of the screen.
            If Android’s gesture navigation is enabled,
            the drawer may be opened by long-pressing on the edge of the screen <a href="https://redmine.stoutner.com/boards/1/topics/243">until the drawer peaks out</a> and then swiping it open.
            Sometimes it can be difficult to get the bookmarks drawer to reliably peak on devices with curved edges, so it is also possible to open the bookmarks drawer from the options menu.</p>

        <p>Tocar em um marcador o abre na guia atual.
            Pressionar longamente um marcador abre-o em uma nova guia e pressionar longamente uma pasta abre todos os favoritos que ela contém diretamente em novas guias.
            Tapping the top floating action button in the bookmarks drawer opens the bookmarks activity, where bookmarks can be edited and reorganized.</p>
